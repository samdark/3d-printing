# General

There are some things that ease 3D-printing regardless of which printer is used.

## Get a good build plate scraper

Use a good scraper which is sharp but without sharp edges on the side
such as [Bambu Lab scraper](https://makerworld.com/en/models/12702-bambu-scraper-grip).

Using other tools you may damage the build plate.

## Get good clippers

XCR3D ones are fine and cheap.

## Get PEI build plate

PEI build plate solves many first layer problems instantly.

## Keep the build plate clean

Wash it with soap and dry every few prints.

## Try glue

After washing the build plate you can apply 3D-printing glue. It might fix two issues:

1. Prints are not sticking enough.
2. Prints are sticking too much.

## Start with PLA and PETG

Both are relatively easy to print with.

## Dry your filament

When filament accumulates moisture it causes all kind of issues: stringing, holes and more.

[Creality Space Pi](https://www.creality.com/products/creality-space-pi-filament-dryer) in all variations is fine
for the purpose.
