# Bambu Lab X1C

This printer just works fine out of the box and doesn't require any tuning.

## Hardware mods

The following proved to work well:

## LAN only mode

The printer can work in LAN without the need to access Internet. It could be turned on in settings.

Extra thing is that you can access it via FTP in this mode using [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/):

- Host: `ftps://x.x.x.x` where `x.x.x.x` is your printer IP address
- Username: `bblp`
- Password is LAN mode access code
